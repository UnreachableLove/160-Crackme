pROTECTIOn - Serial only, Anti-SmartCheck
rULEs -- There is only one rule -> You must find correct serial

Greetings to all crackers out there,

Hope you all sucessfuly crack previous version of crackme...
So here is my new crackme, and the new challenge for you!
Again it's a bit harder to crack then previous verison.
Serial is not hardcoded and you can't find it just looking
with hex editor. You also can't fish it with Sice.
Another think why this crackme is harder then previous one
is because it use few subroutines witch program calls to
generate the serial!...So there are alot of calls :)
This crackme also detects if SmartCheck is loaded and fill
it with tons of messages!
I wrote it for NEWBIES to advance their R. C. E. skills on
cracking Visual Basic programs.

Every version will have one crackme marked "a", and
another one marked with "b".
Crackmes marked with "a" has serial-only protection
and crackmes marked with "b" has name/serial protection!
Also every next version will be more difficult to crack.
[Maybe there will be crackmes marked with "c"(misc. protection)]

Sorry, but I can't give you any hints, because I'm not experienced 
with cracking VB programs, actually I hate them :)

If you somehow lose the exe file, have only this text file and don't 
know where to download the executable, go to the Eternal Bliss' homepage 
and you'll probably find it. The link is http://crackmes.cjb.net/

If you're so stupid that you can't crack this program don't mail me! :)
Mail me only if you sucessfuly crack it, and tell me how.
My Email is -- BornaJanes@hotmail.com

Hope you'll learn something new from it,

Good luck and Enjoy!
